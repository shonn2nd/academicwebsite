	abstract = {The goal of the present study was to map the available evidence and review the existing knowledge base on first-generation college students’ learning in online environments in hopes of pointing out future research directions for the scholarly community and providing implications for practitioners. To this end, a systematic search of electronic databases was conducted to select scholarly sources and grey literature related to online learning involving first-generation college students in higher education settings. The findings of the present review identified several extrinsic barriers that could influence first-generation college students’ success in online environments, such as financial constraints, multiple obligations, and lack of flexibility in course structures. In spite of the hurdles, first-generation college students were both intrinsically and extrinsically motivated to learn in online settings. Further, there was no evidence to show that first-generation college students were less capable of regulating their own learning in online learning environments than their peers. There was no conclusive evidence on the course withdrawal rate and degree completion between generation status, either. However, many studies indicated that first-generation college students who studied in online settings were less likely to perform well and stay in the programs than those who studied in face-toface learning environments. The key to supporting first-generation college students’ learning in online environments is to create inclusive and welcoming learning contexts at course and school levels. Suggestions for future research and implications for online course and program design are discussed.},
